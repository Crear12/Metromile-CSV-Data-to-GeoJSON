# Metromile-CSV-Data-to-GeoJSON
.csv data from Metromile to GeoJSON for OpenStreetMap

I'm taking an interesting course named Intro to GIS, and the problem set requires me to use my own data for map generation. Due to the limitation of Apple, I can't download my significant locations data. Fortunately, I switched to Metromile last winter and I can download my driving records in csv format. The OpenStreetMap will take GeoJSON instead of csv. Therefore, the first extra task is to transform Metromile Data (.csv) to GeoJSON. I would like to publish the tool to help more students/researchers. None homework answers will be published in this repo.

In case Metromile finds this project, I would appreciate it if you can grant me a discount for the insurance.
